 I have created a website using next.js about Car, providing users with the ability to explore and search for various car models and related information. With the help of rapid Api, i was able to get the car information my using cars Api by Api-ninjas and all the pictures from imagin.studio. This web project was both enjoyable and enlightening, as it allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the Next.js framework and its capabilities.
